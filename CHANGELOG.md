# Changelog

## 0.2.1 – unreleased

* Access JWT: service tokens as Cloudflare really sends them (`"sub": ""`, client id in `common_name`) were refused as malformed. Empty `sub`, `email` and
  `common_name` now count as missing; the subject of a service token is its client id. Found while moving `InfinitySuite360.Security.Edge` onto this package.

## 0.2.0 – unreleased

* `InfinitySuite360.Cloudflare`: `ICloudflareAccessJwtValidator` checks the token Cloudflare Access adds to requests (RS256 only, issuer, audience, expiry), with a validated team domain,
  key cache, rate-limited refetch for unknown key ids and a stale-key allowance during outages; `Cloudflare:AccessJwt` settings.
* `InfinitySuite360.Cloudflare.AspNetCore`: authentication scheme `AddCloudflareAccess()` so that `[Authorize]` works, claims for subject, e-mail, service tokens and groups.
  Extracted from the AureonTradeAI MT5 Server gateway (`CloudflareAccessValidator`) and hardened: team domain validation (SSRF), minimum key size, size limits, no redirects when fetching keys.

## 0.1.0

* `InfinitySuite360.Cloudflare.OpenApi`: complete client generated with Kiota 1.36.1 from `cloudflare/api-schemas@650bd71`.
* `InfinitySuite360.Cloudflare`: `ICloudflareClient` with the generated client (`OpenApi`), curated clients and raw access;
  write guard, retries and token-safe errors shared by all three; Turnstile siteverify; dependency injection.
